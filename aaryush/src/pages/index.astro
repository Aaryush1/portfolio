						<p>I work with organizations to redesign how their teams operate with AI. Every engagement starts with deep understanding — what the business actually looks like, where the friction is, and what's possible. From there, targeted experiments to find value fast. If we see ROI on day one, we commit to something larger.</p>

							<p>The model is simple. Someone reaches out with a problem. I spend real time understanding their business — not just the symptom, but what the organization actually looks like today and where the friction is.</p>
							<p>Then I come back with a few targeted solutions for quick experiments — ways to find value without a large upfront commitment. If we see ROI on day one, we commit to something larger. No lengthy proposals. No months of discovery before anything happens.</p>
							<p>Engagements span healthcare, education, and innovation ecosystems. The work ranges from redesigning founder support systems to building compliance-first automation for claims processing — but the through-line is always the same: figure out where AI changes how the organization works, and design for that shift.</p>

							<p>The methodology is what matters here. I'm building what I call Native AI Workflows — a structured system where every team member has the tools and frameworks to evaluate and adopt AI capabilities independently. It's not about one person being technical. It's about making the entire team's output compound.</p>
							<p>We shipped V1 on schedule with a spec-driven development approach that creates long-term leverage. The environment is tool-agnostic — the team works across Claude Code, Cursor, and other agentic tools seamlessly. We maintain a dedicated experiments repo for high-velocity validation before anything hits production.</p>
							<p>The trajectory: AI-driven efficiencies in every department — not just engineering. The goal isn't to add AI to the workflow. It's to redesign the workflow around AI.</p>

Today, every person in the company uses Claude Code and produces output independently. We built a structured system where everything flows from business-level features down to technical implementation step-by-step — no ambiguity, no gaps between what the business needs and what gets built.</p>
							<p>The result: a company that went from early-stage to securing an eight-figure lending facility, with an underwriting operation that processes millions monthly. All the current work is happening on the front end — the core infrastructure is built, and now we're scaling what customers see and touch.</p>

							<p>The platform does end-to-end everything you need for a career: understand how to be better, upskill yourself, and actually find the right opportunities. The business model is white-label and enterprise hiring — we become the infrastructure that companies use to find and evaluate talent.</p>

							<p>Most organizations try to adopt AI by adding it to existing processes — a chatbot here, an automation there. The result is scattered initiatives that never compound. Operating model design starts with a different question: if AI is a core part of how this organization thinks, decides, and executes, what should the structure look like?</p>
							<p>I work with leadership to map how decisions actually flow today, identify where AI changes the calculus, and design the target state — roles, decision rights, information flows, and the systems that connect them. The goal isn't to "add AI." It's to build an organization that's structurally better because of it.</p>

							<p>I design these boundaries for every process — mapping which decisions benefit from AI's speed and which require human judgment. Then I build the connective tissue: confidence scoring that flags uncertainty, escalation paths that route issues to the right people, and feedback loops that make the system sharpen over time.</p>
							<p>The result is a workflow where humans and AI each do what they do best, and the seams between them are invisible.</p>

Privacy requirements, audit trails, and regulatory constraints are designed into the data model and decision flow from day one.

							<p>The result is less time in ambiguity and more time shipping. This is how I've launched platforms on schedule, secured eight-figure facilities, and built products that spread through word of mouth.
